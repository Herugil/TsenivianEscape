The kingdom of Ts√©niva has now been at war for months. Fiercely opposing the idea of going to war,
you were hoping not to get drafted, praying for the war to be short. But fate decided against you. 
For refusing to fight in yet another bloody conflict, you've been thrown in jail and have 
been left there to rot for two weeks.
Left in this dark and damp cell, you're already starting to feel weaker. As you stand staring 
at the wall, exhausted, a great tremor shakes everything around you and throws you to the ground!
Dust starts falling above you. But at last, luck is smiling at you. The wall to your right
crumbles, and you can see it leads to another room, out of your prison!
