After digging out the cave-in with your pickaxe, you run into a
strange scene. A strange looking man, dressed in rags, is 
mumbling some words in front of a bone altar. The room smells 
of decay and dust. As you emerge from the rocks, he finally turns 
his head to you, savagely roars, and a swarm of rats rush towards 
you, their eyes lit with a malevolent red glow.
