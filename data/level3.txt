Behind the door, you see Tsenivian men, smugglers from Volnograd.
They seem well equipped: they wear leather armor, and hold bows and 
swords. The cave is supported by some natural stone pillars. By the
other end of the room, a small stream starts cascading downards, and 
a small boat is tied to a makeshift wooden post with an iron chain.
As soon as the bandits see you, an arrow rushes past your ear, and a 
ferocious woman unsheathes her sword!
