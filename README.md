### TODO:

- Add more actions and passive effects for npcs and player (rat should have disease bite),
  player should have new actions with a number of uses between rests (tomorrow)
  done
- Implement resting mechanic through a bed game object (tomorrow too, fingers crossed)
- Refine level up system so that depending on the picked stat, a new action or passive effect is added (from wednesday)
- Add shields and armor (probably flat damage reduction) (done by the end of the week)
- maybe take the opportunity to refactor item class which kind of sucks (need a dedicated equipment class)
- Quest system (same)
- Unlockable game objects (removes one item with matching id from inventory) (same)
- Save/load !!!! (probs next week), current functions can be used to load game state,
  just need to save game state to a file & add UI to look at available saves

### later

- I need tests :|
- start working on SFML integration
- AI pathfinding should get closer to player if theres no path to reach them
